        <h2 class="mb-4">How does our system work?</h2>

        <p>
            In critical environments such as medicine and defense, it's not enough to fill in a document with any value —
            it is essential to ensure that only <strong>combinations previously approved by a higher authority</strong>
            can be used. Our system enables the creation of documents with dynamic fields (placeholders), where valid combinations
            are digitally signed using <strong>RSA</strong> or authenticated using <strong>HMAC</strong>, ensuring:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrity of the document's content</li>
            <li>Local cryptographic validation without requiring online reauthentication</li>
            <li>Automatic rejection of unauthorized combinations</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> To ensure your document can be signed securely, use square brackets to define
            authorized placeholder options. For example:
            <code>[Name: Leonardo, Tiago, Ricardo]</code> or <code>Acquisition: [OsLicence: CentOS, NixOS, RedHat]</code>.
            These will be interpreted as valid and signable combinations. On the other hand,
            <strong>free text fields are not signed</strong> and should only be used for non-critical data.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Important:</strong> <u>Do not use spaces in the placeholder name</u> (e.g., use
            <code>UserName</code> instead of <code>User Name</code>), otherwise the system will not be able
            to generate a valid signature for that field.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3">Use Case 1: FDA-validated medical prescription</h3>
        <p>
            An oncologist intends to prescribe an aggressive treatment to a patient — for instance, a monoclonal antibody developed by <strong>Roche Pharmaceuticals</strong>.
            However, this treatment can only be used if it has been <strong>pre-approved and digitally signed by the FDA</strong>. The system ensures that:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-1">
            <li>The doctor can only issue the prescription if the selected option is validated by the FDA's signature</li>
            <li>Any attempt to tamper with the content (e.g., by a man-in-the-middle attacker) is detected and blocked</li>
            <li>The patient receives only validated and authorized prescriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mb-3">Use Case 2: Military procurement with high-assurance validation</h3>
        <p>
            A military officer submits a request to acquire encrypted communication modules from <strong>Northrop Grumman</strong>, a major U.S. defense contractor.
            All possible valid combinations (e.g., model, quantity, purpose) are pre-signed by a superior military authority, such as the U.S. Department of Defense.
            The system guarantees that:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-1">
            <li>Only approved options can be submitted for procurement</li>
            <li>An attacker (internal or external) cannot inject invalid combinations since they cannot sign them</li>
            <li>This reduces the risk of sabotage, operational failure, or threats to national or organizational security</li>
        </ul>

                    The <strong>OpenSign</strong> system is designed to ensure that digital documents containing
                    placeholders or multiple-choice fields can be securely signed — even in highly sensitive contexts
                    like healthcare, legal contracts, or government approvals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a combination of <strong>RSA digital signatures</strong>, <strong>AES-256 encryption</strong> for protecting private keys,
                    and secure placeholder validation, OpenSign guarantees document integrity and authenticity
                    even if attackers attempt to manipulate the content.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Private keys are encrypted using AES-256 and a password-derived key (HMAC-SHA256);</li>
                    <li>Each valid placeholder combination can be individually signed to prevent unauthorized completions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even in the event of a targeted system breach (e.g., through malware or privilege escalation),
                    any forged or altered documents will fail validation by end users.
                    <strong>OpenSign protects trust, privacy, and digital integrity</strong>.

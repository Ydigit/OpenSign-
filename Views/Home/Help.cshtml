        <h2 class="mb-4">How does our system work?</h2>

        <p>
            In critical environments such as medicine and defense, it's not enough to fill in a document with any value â€”
            it is essential to ensure that only <strong>combinations previously approved by a higher authority</strong>
            can be used. Our system enables the creation of documents with dynamic fields (placeholders), where valid combinations
            are digitally signed using <strong>RSA</strong> or authenticated using <strong>HMAC</strong>, ensuring:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrity of the document's content</li>
            <li>Local cryptographic validation without requiring online reauthentication</li>
            <li>Automatic rejection of unauthorized combinations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mb-3">Use Case 1: FDA-validated medical prescription</h3>
        <p>
            An oncologist intends to prescribe an aggressive treatment to a patient. However, this treatment can only be used
            if it has been <strong>pre-approved and digitally signed by the FDA</strong>. The system ensures that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The doctor can only issue the prescription if the selected option is validated by the FDA's signature</li>
            <li>Any attempt to tamper with the content (e.g., by a man-in-the-middle attacker) is detected and blocked</li>
            <li>The patient receives only validated and authorized prescriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="my-5" />

        <h3 class="mb-3">Use Case 2: Military procurement with high-assurance validation</h3>
        <p>
            A military officer submits a request to acquire weapons or critical components. All possible valid combinations
            are <strong>pre-signed by a superior military authority</strong>. The system guarantees that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only approved options can be submitted for procurement</li>
            <li>An attacker (internal or external) cannot inject invalid combinations since they cannot sign them</li>
            <li>This reduces the risk of sabotage, operational failure, or threats to national or organizational security</li>
        </ul>

                    The <strong>OpenSign</strong> system is designed to ensure that digital documents containing
                    placeholders or multiple-choice fields can be securely signed â€” even in highly sensitive contexts
                    like healthcare, legal contracts, or government approvals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a combination of <strong>RSA digital signatures</strong>, <strong>AES-256 encryption</strong> for protecting private keys,
                    and secure placeholder validation, OpenSign guarantees document integrity and authenticity
                    even if attackers attempt to manipulate the content.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Private keys are encrypted using AES-256 and a password-derived key (HMAC-SHA256);</li>
                    <li>Each valid placeholder combination can be individually signed to prevent unauthorized completions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Even in the event of a targeted system breach (e.g., through malware or privilege escalation),
                    any forged or altered documents will fail validation by end users.
                    <strong>OpenSign protects trust, privacy, and digital integrity</strong>.

                    from RSA key generation to final document validation. It outlines how secure document creation and
                    cryptographic protection are handled step-by-step by the system.
